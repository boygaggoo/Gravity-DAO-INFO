- [How Embodied Leadership Can Take Your Work to The Next Level.](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIlduiorDkiG9NqnQ6EO0aeZO5zrjgHfFso) Zoom
  > There is a new “normal,” a new world emerging in the midst of all the chaos we currently experience. We know that our work with individuals and families makes a huge difference in their lives and in the lives of all they touch. We are called now to step into the next level of leadership, step more fully into the light of all that is calling us and give our gifts. As Jean Houston says, “These are the times, and WE are the people!” What is needed now more than ever is embodied leadership. This is leadership that comes more from the heart and less from the head. It is relational, compassionate and inclusive. In this podcast we’ll explore this and ways that you can begin to lead from your whole self and begin to make an even greater difference.
