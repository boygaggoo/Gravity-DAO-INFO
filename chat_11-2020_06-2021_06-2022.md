_23-Nov-20 09:16 PM_:	Applying systems thinking, the other approach is to measure "conflict" (however defined) and create a damping feedback loop so designated community stewards get tokens reduced for increasing conflict levels and praise for rapidly resolving. **It takes a village to raise a child**

_26-Nov-20 09:56 AM_:	@Dulce This is the agenda for today:
1. Do you think conflict management should be done with or without a group of people designated to hold accountable for it (Ostrom says Monitors should be accountable to the appropiators or are the appropiators themselves) - So its a) the capacity to manage a conflict is shared between all members or b)designated people are responsible for it
2. what would be boundary of this internal management layer that is proposed? can we have support and legitimaty in both the TEC and de broader TE space, or will it be seen as a "state intervention"
3. How can we apply TE (modeling,simulation, analysis) to make ur conflict management smarter -The initial propose is really a human layer to facilitate communication between stakeholders and provide ADR mechanisms

Punished By Rewards is, I think a way to shine a light on some of the systems we've put in place. Even the Praise System itself might feel less like a good idea after you read it.
                    
When I heard the name of the conflict resolution group was called Gravity, I thought it was great since it pulls all of us together.

_26-Nov-20 01:34 PM_:	I'm showing all this as a result of our own desire to meet the need I hear in the group to have actual data to work with. Alfie Kohn is the one really clear voice for using actual data and studies to show the problems with all punishment/reward systems. We often repeat these punishment/reward systems even though the people participating in them do not really want them, they have become so used to how they work they are in our subconscious assumptions. I see those echoes even in this group, even though I have been made to feel very welcome generally by such an inclusive group.

And if there is going to be a conflict, it seems to me that what is going to happen is inside one of these punishment/reward systems buried in the collective psychological shadow of the group.

_26-Nov-20 02:50 PM_:	So it makes sense to try to shine a light on these things both inside of each individual but also into the structures we create and the assumptions we carry into each structure.

_26-Nov-20 08:30 PM_:	Also, this is itself a tool to deal with things at a human level but knowing which place people are coming from, it's useful to contextualize people's needs in rough groupings. For this I use Spiral Dynamics.

just came here after contemplating how I can help - so one thing I can definitely offer is a recap of important inspiration - that is also important for TEC of course - from Ecosystem Valueflows course:

The conflict I see is this: I see typical mistakes that are being made also being made in TEC - but I have full trust that we can fix whatever will break because we move too fast - but I cannot ignore what I see (and I fail to put it in words that are diplomatic) --&#176; so happy to offer this for the TEC leads when the group is facilitated by @f8 - and we can keep the sessions to 3x 60(+30) mins

The conflict:

_03-Dec-20 02:56 PM_:	I can't make the Thursday calls in the next couple of weeks, but the area of managing communication is my expertise. When speaking about communication, it's useful to think about the actual terminology. Our words create the world. Using the terminology "conflict resolution" is going to create conflicts to resolve. Yes, conflicts are inevitable and often good, and at the same time it might be framed differently. Similarly, the terminology "NonViolent Communication" implies that communication could be violent. Other disciplines do not have that attitude and represent personal responsibility both on the output and input sides (what you hear and how you hear it). I would be happy to help but I would like you to guide me in what ways my contribution could be most useful.

_03-Dec-20 03:02 PM_:	Compassionate Communication is an alternate name for this approach of Rosenberg's as well. I have the same observations about Ostrom's work, which is also very colonized in it's thinking when you read the book.

<h3>GraceRachmany#9780  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/519634011908341760/c599ceae790b944e0dca6259b445526e.png" width="25" height="25" /></h3>

_03-Dec-20 03:06 PM_:	Not sure what "colonized" means in this context. One of the issues that I'm seeing in conversation now is this idea of "fragility" where people can't be with certain communications. Being offended, hurt, etc., by communication can cause a situation where everyone is walking on eggshells and there are certain things that can't be said. Training people to be anti-fragile and just face the "offense" when it happens is an important part of the training. One of the disadvantages of some kinds of training is that it only seems to work well if everyone in the conversation is "obeying the rules" or trained in that form of communication. It is possible to train people in a sort of communication that allows absolutely full communication with anyone, at any time, in any situation.

_03-Dec-20 03:15 PM_:	Well, I do think it's not invaluable to keep in mind the history of the cultural context in which we're speaking. This is, like Neil Postman speaks about a kind of "thermostatic response" to the imbalance in a cultural dialectic. So, if one is to speak with a proper context one can understand the needs and feelings underlying someone's experience, rather than invalidating it. This is indeed a compassionate approach. So colonization did happen and the echoes of this reverberate in certain populations today and the cultural frameworks of violence, exclusion and assumption still exist in those cultures today and often without our ability to consent or opt-out of them. Thus, it is in this way I see the titling of Marshall Rosenberg's work. I was agreeing with you in the sense that you mentioned the terminology of "Non-Violent" implies violence and apart from the reasons I listed above, I am saying Ostrom's book contains terms like "Third World" which is fundamentally a term used in the sense of colonization. Indeed, the monetary system is set up much the same way as we heard from the Spirit Foundation in the call just now.

I think it's in this group's potential to avoid such scenarios and work toward subverting such assumptions to the degree to which we can.

_03-Dec-20 03:29 PM_:	Hello Grace! so happy to see you here, i remember a statement you were developing on the crypto law lab about how most economic profit is not valuable for humankind, look forward to be able to keep having dialogues with you. Also i understand that "conflict management" and "graduated sanctions" can be troublesome terms, but to be antifragile as humans and then also as organizations is to be able to manage our conflicts and behave according to social agreements, that in our case are descentralized, so initially i like those terms.

So it's not necessarily bad to refer to general concepts when you are developing a statement over them -using them as a variable for further conceptualization-.

_03-Dec-20 03:42 PM_:	One could see, for example, Mona Eltahawy's The Seven Necessary Sins For Women and Girls as a similar issue around feminism-as-response-to-oppression

So, from where I sit, this kind of understanding is key to understanding how to arrive at a balance, but especially when we are building the tools underneath economies. The unwise application of a principle or an assumption on the part of the framers of this tech can easily have implications that might exist only in the subconscious of the people framing it. And it is this I am eager to shine a light on so we can avoid those problems down the line when pressures are high not only for time.

_03-Dec-20 03:54 PM_:	These are fair perspectives,. Personally, I try to stay out of framing everything in an oppressor/oppressed framework. I think it's a bit overused today and also doesn't respect the fact that the power dynamic is a normal and natural cycle of personal and societal development. We are at a new cycle of development which will include and transcend,. My sense is that some of the oppressed/oppressor dialogue is fixated with setting things right or repairing some damage, rather than seeing this as part of a developmental progression that had to be passed through in order to reach the next level.

Repairing the past is always doomed to failure. As humans, we are designed to move in a linear forward progression in the temporal dimension.

_03-Dec-20 04:28 PM_:	Well, if it was something left long ago in the past then I wouldn't be mentioning it. It's alive in our cultural "legacy codebase" up to this minute. Being aware of those influences is really all I'm talking about here. If none of that existed, we wouldn't have any need for conflict resolution at all.

_05-Dec-20 10:30 PM_:	it is partly social signalling (shunning/exile) and partly netiquette (as to what is acceptable). Because of lack of physical proximity, IMHO the token is a proxy representation of reputation and social standing. In extremis there may be legal sanctions (like confiscation in case of fraud).

_05-Dec-20 10:36 PM_:	It is possible to train people in a sort of communication that allows absolutely full communication with anyone, at any time, in any situation.
There are a lot of structured communications from formal (Robert rules of order) to ethical (Chatham House rules). It is up to TEC to come up with a minimum positivism subset to encourage vigorous debate on the various channels without degenerating into name-calling or vulnerable to external trolling. Best implementation of evidenced-based policy (as per Geek Manifesto)

_06-Dec-20 08:40 AM_:	Hey  We are researching various alternative justice approaches and models, to take what we consider the best of them for the design of our our own (for decentralized communities).  The initial discussion is showing us two scopes on monitoring capabilities. 1) where a group of people is held accountable for providing ADR to the community, and 2), where the community itself proposes procedures to moderate themselves (like Chatham House rules for selected topics). I see benefits in both of them and think we can have mixed approaches.

_10-Dec-20 09:41 AM_:	Hello Everyone! Today's Gravity Wg agenda is the following:

Icebreaker question: If you were some type of edible, what would you be? üòÇ

1. Keep promoting the use of the Typeform [https://the-commons-stack.typeform.com/to/rCVsK5RK](https://the-commons-stack.typeform.com/to/rCVsK5RK) 
2. Can we have consent that having a group of members inside the community that is accountable of facilitating ADR for the community is still mutual-monitoring? and that there is no external influence on them. Why? 

a) The monitors are the members of the community
b) Everyone can fill the typeform and inform issues, even with conflict managers.

[TEC Gravity - Conflict management](https://the-commons-stack.typeform.com/to/rCVsK5RK)

Easy access for conflict management mechanisms

3. Review the epic "Conflict Mgmt Role Design" 
[Conflict Mgmt Role Design &#183; Issue #130 &#183; TECommons/coordination](https://github.com/CommonsBuild/coordination/issues/130)

_07-Jan-21 12:12 PM_:	4 types of listening by Otto Scharmer
**Dowloading**: This type of listening is limited to reconfirming what we already know. Nothing new penetrates our bubble.
**Factual listening**: We let the data talk to us and notice disconfirming information. Doing this requires opening the mind ‚Äî that is, the capacity to suspend our habits of judgment.
**Empathic listening:** We see the situation through the eyes of another. Doing this requires opening the heart: using our feelings and our heart as an organ of tuning in to another person‚Äôs view.
**Generative listening:** We listen for the highest future possibility to show up while holding a space for something new to be born.

_26-Jan-21 01:18 PM_:	My thoughts as I'm in this SoftGov meeting: Accountability is the tension between the creation of trust and the resolution of conflict, since something "not done" in a participatory democracy is a kind of "conflict" in a broad sense.

Anyone else have any thoughts on this?

_27-Jan-21 10:42 AM_:	I agree. Lack of accountability breaks trust, and without trust mutual accountability measures might be perceived as aggressive, but people have different thresholds for acquiring or losing trust. It's definitely a puzzle

I think studying conflict mediation in crypto communities is a hugely important topic

I&#39;ve personally been involved with some circle-based dialogue practices, like Bohm Dialogue and Circling and some NVC-adjacent stuff

I&#39;m really interested in how to bring some of that knowledge into crypto communities.

 _22-Jun-21 06:28 AM_:

Hi, um I&#39;m not sure if this is a gravity issue, but here we go -
Someone in the server(<span class="pre pre--inline">Coarse#1173) that just entered yesterday invited all of the latest batches of spam scammer bots into the server. We can be sure that it was them, due to our new friend @InviteLogger 

What would be the relevant step forward?

Here&#39;s what I did as a damage control-
- Deleted the invite that they created (<span class="pre pre--inline">FcM5sWSj, as can be seen below that let in 45 bots, and it was a temporary invite so no one notices)
- Banned some of the bots(I&#39;m gonna try and Ban all of them)
- For now, I suspended invite creation and talking permissions from the one who created that invite.

 The invite creator is probably not a bot, and may be a human.
Considering that the style of these messages have been consistent, can it be possible that Coarse is an alternate account of some ill-actor in the server, who keeps inviting these scam bots? Following this, should we <span class="pre pre--inline">prune our members?
Q) What would <span class="pre pre--inline">prune mean?
Ans - It would be removing anyone from the server that hasn&#39;t attended a call, and hasn&#39;t interacted in the server for 3 months.

I didn&#39;t ban Coarse yet, since i was hoping that maybe there can be some dialogue here, or something before we ban them?

I have some reservations about the kicking people off the server. I am on serveral discords where I haven&#39;t joined a call or posted to a channel in several months but I do stop in and read to see what&#39;s happening in those projects when I have time. 

Will this precuation be so effective against spammers that it&#39;s worth kicking off real people to achieve it? Does it work well for other projects that do it?

 _22-Jun-21 05:09 PM_:

hmm, that&#39;s true..
Perhaps, we could use some different approach?
Might be a bit more work though - text these people and see if they reply?

I&#39;m not sure about other projects(1hive atleast doesn&#39;t do a prune)

We could also maybe just not do the prune process, and wait for anyone getting more spam, and then banning the accounts. Usually the spam accounts are temporary(They&#39;re like a one-time raid and dump, that people proliferating the spam buy for 10mins or something and it&#39;s a lot less likely that they&#39;re gonna use the same bots again)

I&#39;ve gone back to working on the <span class="pre pre--inline">TEC Automation bot, and maybe some time soon we will have a process where anyone entering the server would have to go and fill a captcha on the site

Would having everyone do a captcha, which if they pass gives them a one-time-use code, which they then have to reply to a bot on here (much like the ‚úÖ reaction upon joining the server)  help? We‚Äôd just have to put everyone through a filter like that again.

This is very Christian based, but the principles align with our values:
<div class="quote">Conflict is a slippery slope.
Conflict starts in the heart.
Choices have consequences.
Wise-way choices are better than my-way choices.
The blame game makes conflict worse.
Conflict is an opportunity.
The Five A‚Äôs can resolve conflict.
Forgiveness is a choice.
It is never too late to start doing what‚Äôs right.

I hope it&#39;s okay to pass on some personal experience, and maybe this is already covered for CSTK / TECMNS ...

It&#39;s not always possible for a community to support an individual, there are limits, because the individual also has a responsibility to support themselves, but can struggle with this in certain situations.

Where an individual begins to struggle to support themselves, or has always had difficulties in some respects, community needs to recognise sometimes that specialist skills are needed.

However much I have wanted to be inclusive and involve folk in the autistic spectrum, or folk with hyper sensitivity, I have tended to struggle in dialogue with them, and also it&#39;s very hard to dialogue with folk on the verge of a breakdown for whatever reason.

Sometimes such folk can be in pain, because of their situation, but it&#39;s not possible to help them.

At this point, specialist skills and high levels of compassion are needed, to try to interact in humane yet constructive ways.

Certain organisations I work with are very clear that in extreme circumstances it is necessary to refer folk in distress to professionals, and having this as an option can be really helpful in a community setting.

I hope this is a helpful discussion point, and that I&#39;m putting my point in the right place in the community.

Keen to hear what folk here think about this.

 _05-Aug-21 12:21 PM_:

I would also point out that we have constructed a society in which SO MANY barriers exist to bringing people back into their own Optimal Arousal Zones, and we also have MANY reasons why we, almost perpetually, prevent people from getting into these optimal states. It&#39;s systemic. For example, &quot;junk food&quot; is almost all people can afford when they are lower income. Given the links of food consumption to mental health, one can start to see the tip of the iceberg. There are MANY such examples.

So, if you KNOW you are being discriminated against, an appropriate response to this is anger, but then that would push you out of the Window Of Tolerance

If you become numb to it, then you are also out of the Window of Tolerance

So, if we are building a monetary structure that is intended to rebalance the extractive manner in which our money is handled, we must know these larger contexts also.

I would point out that I am a significant contributor to the TEC and yet I am a person on the autism spectrum

Ever heard of food deserts? [https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/45014/30940_err140.pdf](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/45014/30940_err140.pdf) 

These are places where finding good healthy food is challenging, and primarily targets low-income areas.

 _10-Aug-21 11:47 PM_:

Thank you for replying, this is such a difficult area.

I do think knowledge and awareness are important to this larger discussion, to both sets of people.

What might be needed for example are code words that can be used and some outline constructive responses that mean folk know when they are triggering other folk even accidentally.

This would be some helpful protocol to help folks involved try to see things from the other person&#39;s point of view.

I wanted to share this here first, on a commons basis, alhtough I may need some guidance on that, because of my experiences during the pandemic, and how far I think things have come since 20th century practice ...

Clearly, I&#39;m seeing DAOs as operating with far more oxygen than some of the other groups I encountered over the past 18 months ... Although there are nuances and circumstances I&#39;m sure in which it makes more sense to operate outside of this description of Inclusive behaviours.

Hi @durgadas , I felt moved to make a contribution, above, about inclusive working, which I&#39;m enjoying here in the DAO, does it have some meaning? Likely I&#39;m missing something, so some feedback would be lovely, if you can spare a minute. Thanks.

This is an excellent observation. I am trying to see how this might layer into my own graphic above about Gravity-style interacting? How might I add these layers to that?

It does seem relevant to that &#39;flow&#39;

Also, I would perhaps add to the stark duality of this to include something in the middle like &quot;win-win&quot; because it seems to me that real inclusion not only is &quot;free&quot; but there must be a place for reciprocal benefit where we both do well or everyone does well or benefits, even if the benefits are changing according to the &quot;type&quot; aka the 8 forms of wealth: [Sharma: The 8 Forms of Wealth - SUCCESS](https://www.success.com/sharma-the-8-forms-of-wealth/)

Hey y&#39;all this is allllllll sortsa up my alley. I found the gravitron spreadsheet and threw my name on it and then i searched through the server and read everything i could find on the topic, same as the blogspace.  [trauma / identity / conflict / neurodiversity / shadow / bias = i geek out real hard on this stuff I believe there are so many overlaps when beings communicate]

How can I become more engaged? I live in PST and have a wicked hard time scheduling globally...its been a steep learning curve for me.

</div> 
**The book is called Beyond Inclusion Beyond Empowerment - A Developmental Strategy To Liberate Everyone**
 the Author is **Leticia Nieto.**
 I read the first page and uploaded it to soundcloud so I only have to describe the book once when my friends ask. The first page is rich. She did not agree to mentor me...She put me in connection with three mentors who are willing to help me get through this architecture.  I&#39;m Jazzed.

I fumbled some words, no ones perfect.

 _03-Sep-21 12:23 AM_:

Dear <span class="mention">#&#128330;ÔΩúgravity folk, may I ask a question please?

In the case of conflict management, there may be times when we feel we have insufficient knowledge with a particular situation, or indeed that we feel we cannot give an issue the time it deserves in a particular moment in time.

Is Gravity allowing of such circumstances? Meaning that some disputes might be hard to resource for mediation purposes?

I&#39;m feeling a little guilty over in Twitter that I wanted to opt out of a particular discussion, ducking the issue as it was described.

But we should be able to opt out of or into a situation as capacity and ability allows.

Does Graviton Training address this?

I&#39;m keen on the upcoming Graviton Training, but am hoping that personal circumstances don&#39;t make me a poor candidate.

Thank you.

PS I love the natural instinct @DaveW , who I see already has an abundance of skills doing this, he&#39;d be a fabulous Graviton.

I can&#39;t help but respond to this. I encourage gravity like types to engage too.

@innov8tor3 I hope you were able to shake off any guilt you were experiencing, it just is not necessary at all. I am proud of you for speaking up for what you needed. There are conflicts that I don&#39;t put my energy or attention on. I&#39;m still upset about not clarifying the bias that was present in the last kerfuffle I had with an autism activist. 
Some times I choose not to engage because I am putting attention on myself self care. I don&#39;t have to act everytime I see an occurrence. 

I generally have the capacity and desire to turn towards conflict but that&#39;s in part because I&#39;ve experienced a profound amount of it since birth. The other part is it gets easier with experience. 

Lastly you said you were ducking our of the issue...
I don&#39;t believe this to be a truth in grounded in reality and I also don&#39;t want to gaslight your experience but I want to note that I know you did the right thing. You noticed that you were being upset by the posts and spoke up. You didn&#39;t attack anyone which is rare these days with folx. Besides there were a handful of eyes and voices engaged. 

I&#39;m glad you mentioned what you have here...all of it. 
I am absolutely certain there will be an opt out if someone is not up for a conflict. (It would be unrealistic to attempt anything different) The alternative is subjecting yourself to further activation which could be a re traumatization depending on the sensitivity of ones brain and nervous system. 

I hope that a bunch of people will show up for this training that way there are so many people holding the various lenses needed to catch people in crisis. Also plenty of backup/ rotation for burnout. 

There are a bunch of classes ...you don&#39;t need to memorize it all...you pull out the threads that you were meant to carry and trust that the collective will gather the rest. Together we can hold it all. Power of community.

Thank you, I really appreciate this!

You are clearly a very caring soul, and we certainly need more like you!

I do agree with you about trauma, it can often make us respond sub-optimally, but on the other hand we can become more empathetic.

Again, thank you!

Oh yes, for sure, the will of the parts and the competence of the Graviton are really important parts of Gravity&#39;s alternative conflict management process. in the role design of the Graviton, we propose certain exigences that need to be respected to participate in facilitating cases

[Gravity - Role design](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/gravity-role-design/174)

> Gravity role design Epic: [https://github.com/TECommons/coordination/issues/130](https://github.com/TECommons/coordination/issues/130)   Rules and boundaries are key for managing Common Pool Resources, and monitoring gives legitimacy to agreements toward maintaining trust and collective goodwill.  We are proposing a mutual-monitoring system, where each one of us can inform any issue (through the Gravi...
ffd103eeda16b5f36d93f2909785859dd9ee73cb.png">

Gravity members must commit to additional exigences that are required to join and stay in the collective. Such as:

Voluntary Process: All members in the Gravity group participate without coercion from any actor.

Self-Determination: Recognize the ability to promote voluntary agreements. The mediator facilitates the management of disputes but the outcomes belong to the parties.

Conflict of interest: Recognize when they are not capable of facilitating a conversation for any possible bias reason, personal or professional.

Competence: As we are a community of experts, the mediator, besides being trained in Alternative Dispute Resolution, should be able to prove deep understanding of the specific topics that the dispute may be about.

Confidentiality: Information related to these processes should be handled privately, and strategically shared with the agreement by the parties. Unwanted information filtered by the mediator is a reason to remove from the Gravity group.

Impartiality and neutrality: The Gravity group members should lead by their example of empathy and acceptance of different points of view, with freedom from favouritism.

Professional Responsibility: Gravity members should assume the task of mediating in the organization with diplomacy and prudence.

Rotation: Three times a year, new training and selection processes will be run to encourage members of the community to become part of the Gravity team. One can only be in this group for three years in a row, to avoid accumulation of power.

We have a variety of Gravitons, and according to the case, we can include persons who can feel competent, self determined, without conflict of interest, confidential, impartial and professionally responsible for their role as mediator.

> Dear <span class="mention">#&#128330;ÔΩúgravity folk, may I ask a question please?

In the case of conflict management, there may be times when we feel we have insufficient knowledge with a particular situation, or indeed that we feel we cannot give an issue the time it deserves in a particular moment in time.

Is Gravity allowing of such circumstances? Meaning that some disputes might be hard to resource for mediation purposes?

I&#39;m feeling a little guilty over in Twitter that I wanted to opt out of a particular discussion, ducking the issue as it was described.

But we should be able to opt out of or into a situation as capacity and ability allows.

Does Graviton Training address this?

I&#39;m keen on the upcoming Graviton Training, but am hoping that personal circumstances don&#39;t make me a poor candidate.

Thank you.

PS I love the natural instinct @DaveW , who I see already has an abundance of skills doing this, he&#39;d be a fabulous Graviton.

 _07-Sep-21 12:42 PM_:

I did the Graviton training for my personal development.
Because you&#39;ve had the training doesn&#39;t obligate you to use your training whenever a conflict arises.
I think I&#39;m reading the question correctly?

 _08-Sep-21 03:51 AM_:

Wow! You guys blow me away with the work that&#39;s been done, and on a collective basis too! Consensus is so hard to achieve!

I think it&#39;s great, can we share this with other folk who want to understand what is involved?

I have &quot;only&quot; two questions at this point:

1. What does this mean, please ...

&quot;Unwanted information filtered by the mediator is a reason to remove from the Gravity group&quot;

2. In the impartiality section, the difficulty comes where a decision might have to favour one party or another in any dispute, which might seem to mitigate against the impartiality. Are there rules / processes for where folk want to appeal against the decision, based on a &quot;feeling&quot; around unintentional bias? I&#39;m guessing transparency of process, but within confidentiality bounds, must play a part ...

<div class="quote">Gravitron training is like the bookclub of my dreams...but on crack. 
(I couldn&#39;t find another way to express that with the vocabulary I have become aware of)

Vocabulary plays a factor in conflict. It is often linked to ones awareness which can only be raised by exposure. Our environments affect our behavior, our social conditioning is what makes us get crunchy in social situations. 

I love this stuff.

Fantastic job @Juankbell 

Two observations:

1) I feel like I&#39;ve come home here in TEC / Gravity, I even chat with Dave Snowden over in FB, and already a big Ostrom fan ...

2) Listening today, I&#39;m already starting to understand the chaos, assumed justice systems and unresolved conflicts in other DAOs ...

Again, I&#39;m so glad to be here!

**11. How do I claim a POAP?**

<div class="quote">When you attend a POAP-sponsored event, the organizer will distribute claim codes in the form of QR codes or URLs. Scan the QR code or enter the URL in your browser to claim the POAP using your Ethereum address, or enter your email to reserve the POAP so you can claim it at a later time.
So just wait until either the Discord bot works or a link for the claim code is sent to you manually.

 _22-Sep-21 12:05 AM_:

The best training is the sort that is put to work immediately to embed the learning.

I see Twitter disputes regularly, and love Twitter, and don&#39;t want to see it spoiled by disputes.

So @Juankbell , do you think there is an echo from the Cynefin model here, of trying to see the complexity in a situation (Tokens Vs Holochain Vs Bitcoin) and trying for a solution that might pacify passionate advocates on 3 sides?

(A three deep thread response ...)

[https://twitter.com/innov8tor3/status/1440522177606914049?s=19](https://twitter.com/innov8tor3/status/1440522177606914049?s=19) 

Also, I haven&#39;t seen it yet, but that point about putting learning into action straight away is critical for folk to really take learning on board and for it to stick.

Blooms Taxonomy was my inspiration there, made a huge difference to me and underpinned much of my approach to learning online.

And yes, needs a horizontal presentation as a journey not a &quot;climb to the top&quot;, but does indicate that many people give up on that journey at different stages, not pushing through to the rather wonderful conclusion of synthesis.

Maybe the Blooms model is there but just intrinsic, rather than overt?

> @wor @HOLOptik @Hessu357 @dilgreen @T_Fleischman @matslats @tecmns I agree üíØ%.

For 5 years, we had - IMHO, of course - some decent EduTech software. The issue was we needed to convince marketplace incumbents to give the software a try, to adopt.

Soft skills were key: presentation, persuasion, negotiation,  ...

Complexity Vs Fragmented ...

 _22-Sep-21 12:28 AM_:

Maybe you guys can solve a problem I&#39;m having?

I see three styles of Discord Comms:

1) Snap comments - pure dialogue
2) Structured thinking - connecting aspects together
3) &quot;Unstructured&quot; thinking - thinking out loud often emotionally

My style is typically 2), though I can use 1).

Some DAOs actively dislike 2), prefer 1), and miss the opportunity for deeper dialogue that 2) offers, IMV.

And then with 3), I find my style, trying to seek the sources of pain I hear in 3), just doesn&#39;t work with 3) style dialogue people. My failing, I strongly suspect.

(I&#39;m loving the Graviton Training already!)

But can Gravitons work asynch as well, on specific problems - again, my belief, this can offer faster progress - and if so where is a good place to do that?

Thanks!

Apologies, I&#39;m really on  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•  by the Graviton training ...

OK, so now I&#39;m learning about Community Management &amp; Governance with you guys, I want to put knowledge to work ASAP rocky! Always my bad habit, wanting to run ASAP, not sure yet if I know how to walk.

Hearing @durgadas talk about confusion in other communities, and having the same experience myself, I wondered whether a perspective on our collective TEC travels might be helpful. Folk here are very welcome to use this, it&#39;s an amalgam of stuff that&#39;s already out there in the big blue web. I don&#39;t know yet about the full toolkit here of course, and happy to work on better comms and approaches.

Love to hear your thoughts, you guys!

Oh ...  PS ... These DAO confusions are opportunities for TEC, if and only if the partner DAO is seeing the need, and TEC have planted seeds / stated capabilities in a succinct enough fashion.

Last one for now, promise ...

5m summary of first session from yesterday, from the Governance WG in the TEC Gravity DAO.

Mind blowing, and there are 9 more sessions !!!

Includes a definite side reference to discord - the word, not the tech - in communities, of any size, including very small communities!

TEC clearly see that community building is key to creative development, and this can help other groups I&#39;m working with.

I am so sorry I can&#39;t attend the Graviton session today, family matters to resolve I&#39;m afraid.

I do hope there will be a recording to listen to, because I&#39;m keen to go through the learning even if I can&#39;t be present.

Thanks.

 _28-Sep-21 03:04 PM_:

Holi, I&#39;m LB and I&#39;m from the SourceCred community. Conflict makes me so uncomfortable, but I&#39;ve gained a lot of resilience to it through the building up of our space at SC. I joined this because Aloysious told me about it and when I took a look I could tell these were skills I wanted to have, both for my work in Web3 but also just for myself as a human being.

 _28-Sep-21 03:09 PM_:

Hey folks! I am Maggie (they/them pronouns), also from SourceCred, also here because of Aloysious&#39; invitation üíú 

I am here because I was very much raised in an environment where conflict was very present while simultaneously feared and avoided. I wasn&#39;t raised with tools to be able to be in a healthy relationship with conflict and as a result it is often very activating/triggering for me, and I am excited about building a healthier relationship with it so I can be a part of being in healthier communities. So many things that were shared today were so helpful for shifting my embodied stories about conflict.. This quote (and really everything else on the slide) hit me real deep, &quot;One way to truly know our humanness is to recognize the gift of conflict in our lives. Without it, life would be a monotonously flat topography of sameness and our relationships would be woefully superficial.&quot;

hello friends,
Knic here ‚Äî any pronouns for me are fine! i default to they/them.

i am about to get in a car and won‚Äôt be able to introduce myself in live time.

i help organize communities, love performing music, and often serve as default tech support for folx. 

this course is already helpful for me to consider viewing conflict as a generative force, and seeing peace as embedded within justice. 

thanks for a full and expanding session today, @Juankbell

### October 2021

 _02-Oct-21 11:54 AM_:

I&#39;m curious what I&#39;m agreeing to down the road when it comes to processes/the communication architecture piece in the conflict resolution process.  

Where might I find the documents we will be using to support conflict?

Where do I find the processes we will be using to make decisions?

 _05-Oct-21 03:12 PM_:

Regarding pathways for inclusion (which we discussed in the gravity session): 
I personally feel that the TEC sometimes uses a very specific terminology (words like Cynefin) or very dense info graphics  referring to dense concepts. 
Not knowing much about these concepts can make people feel excluded.
Perhaps, a simpler lingo or more explanations/examples would be helpful to include new people in discussions about such topics.
I also see that this can slow down discussions for more experienced members because this densely packed terms are certainly faster in communicating information.

 _05-Oct-21 03:17 PM_:

Something I was saying in group 6 (I believe/the one with Nate lol) when the time went up, is that we have a saying that &quot;the shape of an organization inform how the relationships are structured&quot;. In an hierarchical org, the labels of the roles create a superior-subordinate relationship, which them creates scarcity - restricting the activities one might actually take part etc. 
In a DAO space, I see that we intend to create a fluid and horizontal shape, bringing more abundance of roles and possibilities.
Nonetheless, we are sometimes so embedded in a hierarchical society that our mental models struggle to adapt and we end up replicating some limiting beliefs even in a DAO, which might resonate sometimes in a struggle to see where one can contribute/benefit because of the different structure.
I&#39;m not saying that we need some sort of hierarchy, on the contrary.. I think everyone wanting to participate in a DAO might take some time to reflect and observe their own behavior regarding structured-unstructured relationships, because it involves a lot of emotional awareness

 _05-Oct-21 03:18 PM_:

Thanks everyone who joined today&#39;s Gravity session. The two scenarios we explored in breakout groups were:

**Creating spirals into and out of positions of greater responsibility.**

Ideas for this could include: rituals of honouring and appreciation, time-bound roles, advisor roles that people can step into, supported hiatus (or offboarding) periods and clear processes on how to do that, and knowledge sharing tools that pass over key information to those that step into new roles so those leaving know they can safely pass their role on.
 
**Creating various pathways for inclusion, participation, and autonomy.**

Ideas for this could include: groups of various sizes, clear internal information pathways, time-bound roles, maximum group sizes, setting up pods or crews (small groups of not more than 7 that meet regularly with a particular focus), facilitated spaces for difficult community conversations about power, hierarchies, social capital, gender, and inclusion, and spaces in calls for reflection and contemplation.

Here are the notes from group 3 @G0RD0 (unfortunately missed a username. if u see this say üëã )

few highlights from what i&#39;ve absorbed: 
- creating a culture of mutual care &amp; letting go. a culture that welcomes vulnerability. 
- On boarding: a role which keeps a close look on newcomers, establish personal contact &amp; understand the needs (specially for marginalized ppl).  Someone who has gotten in touch diverse backgrounds. 
- Off boarding: gratitude / continuity check 

praise thom for taking notes :D

 _05-Oct-21 11:14 PM_:

One of the previous 2 Graviton sessions covered Cynefin in outline, which is basically the journey from Confusion to Clarity.

It is possible to look up those previous sessions for Graviton Season 2 by finding the sessions on YouTube, searching for &quot;token engineering commons&quot; , filtering / sorting using most recent, and looking back over the previous two Tuesdays ...

Another option is to Google the 3D version of Cynefin on Google Images, which has a really neat diagram that explains the Cynefin journey in more detail.

I agree with you, a jump from one step to a later step means that missed steps and discussion leads to later confusion, I get this myself, quite a lot.

Has this been of some help?

Cynefin was just an example for such a term. I also attended the second gravity and heard about the concepts. Still, in discussions - even more as a non-native speaker - it might be hard to follow if many of those terms are thrown around.

yesterday&#39;s session was an excellent dive, thanks @ddan for your efforts! i thought your presentation was well-designed and clear.

Question for the room:

i screwed up and lost my recovery phrase for my ethereum wallet (which i created to mint POAPs for this course ‚Äî fortunately will not lose access to anything else!). i will not make this mistake again.

i do still have the Ethereum address for the wallet i lost access to. 

the options i can figure out:

1. i can continue minting POAPs into that wallet, i just won&#39;t have access to the wallet to &quot;spend&quot; anything. maybe that doesn&#39;t matter?
2. i can make a new wallet, receive the remaining POAPs, and shrug off the first four.
3. or perhaps there&#39;s a way to easily generate new tokens for the first four POAPs?

does anyone have a suggestion on the best way to move forward? 
(would especially love guidance from @ALOYSIOUS, as y&#39;all seem to be very familiar with these nuts and bolts. not an assignment, however! no pressure or expectation.)

thank you for understanding my ignorance, and for your time reading this.

 _14-Oct-21 08:31 AM_:

Hey @knic ! all possibilities sound good. 

1. you can continue collecting the POAPs of the training in the account you lost keys because they will only be used as certification of becoming a Graviton (with 6+)
2. we could keep in mind that you used two accounts, and count the ones you already have in that account with the ones you will continue claiming in the new address.
3. This is the hardest one because on some of this sessions all the links generated were used and distributed.

- Thank god you didn&#39;t have funds there, we all have had this kind of shocks. (once i sent some Eth to a proxy contract - Thankfully @griff (&#128156;, &#128156;) helped me to recover them)

PRE-LEARNING

Restorative justice circles [https://oscr.umich.edu/article/restorative-justice-circles](https://oscr.umich.edu/article/restorative-justice-circles)

PRESENTATION / WORKSHOP

Intro: Acknowledgement of our teachers &amp; the legacy of circle-based justice built by millenia of pre-colonial cultures

Restorative Justice Theory: Dispute resolution can be fully decentralized, and what does fully decentralized mean

Are you in an org currently? Do you have a stated conflict process? Would you know what to do if a team conflict arose?
Brainstorm what types of conflict resolution can you think of? Is there a centralized party in each of these?
Why doesn‚Äôt centralization work? (Review current justice systems)
Go over quotes from FTP and D. Barter
Practical Implementation: How to set up a conflict res process in your org

Selecting a method
Facilitators
Training for Facilitators
Team agreement to use the method
Time resolving conflict is paid time
Company culture: Celebrate conflict!

 _19-Oct-21 04:26 PM_:

We have been doing the homework!
1.  Gravity proposes a method.
2. gravitons are facilitators. 
3. Gravity trains gravitons, 
4.  promote agreement of applying the method (or others) 
5. (mid term) become DAO that rewards energy spent on this activities 
6.  Develop culture of competence and understanding of promoting trust and managing conflict.

I saw a nice crypto guide recently, about exchange and wallets, but then I felt the following sections were relevant and could or should be referenced, from an Ostrom perspective ...

&quot;1. Earning Crypto
2. Community Contribution
3. Working Asynch

Rationale, TLDR follows ...

Rationale ...

1. Earning capability means there is something to exchange. Without this it is exclusionary to &quot;have not&quot;s, because they cannot participate.

2. So as to earn, folk need to be able to make a contribution. This is surprisingly difficult, when folk are working at distance from one another.

3. The human need to work face to face does matter, but in an asynch setting we need to get better at asynch working. This is not impossible, people have managed this using email for decades, and changing to chat should not be an impassable barrier. It&#39;s particularly relevant in DAOs because the need to meet face to face gets harder for older folk, who have family demands to meet, meaning less time available. This is normally overcome by a human tendency to throw money when time is not available, but not everyone has spare money to throw around. The grey workforce has much to contribute, but some difficult working constraints.&quot;

Would love your thoughts on this, if you feel okay to do so.

This is different from traditional leadership where the leader&#39;s main focus is the thriving of their company or organizations. A servant leader shares power, puts the needs of the employees first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible....

 _02-Nov-21 03:35 PM_:

One of my favourites, bottom up leadership, supportive leadership ...

At times, leaders need to ask followers for support, a leader needs to be able to see when this is needed, else progress can become less possible ...

Assigning roles helps folk see what they can do, it does help, but equally they need to agree that role

 _02-Nov-21 03:54 PM_:

Can we transcend our own typical characteristic, use a different persona when we need to, so as to return closer to the goal we are pursuing?

Is goal alteration evidence of some kind of progress?

I think forming is a response to chaos. We see chaos and as a leadership response say we need to do something ...

Leadership always involves compromise, and so cannot be perfect!

A leader wants to be led by others who understand leadership!

S3 has tons of other helpful patterns so I highly encourage anyone in this group to read about them and try them out.

 _13-Nov-21 12:10 AM_:

I think one organisational driver here is community building.

I suspect, with some inspection, that there will be more commonalities in approach with S3.

What can often happen in research and development is that one researcher will take a particular path, choosing particular factors, and using different language.

End outcomes can sound different, but have similarities. And yet still folk will lean one way or the other.

If you haven&#39;t looked at Elinor Ostrom yet, and her 8 principles, that will give you one of the founding drivers here ... And another founding factor is autonomy, meaning adapting theory to local practical use.

I&#39;m still learning, so I don&#39;t have a complete picture.

 _16-Nov-21 02:39 PM_:

I don&#39;t appreciate when my autonomy is taken away because people are conditioned by thier enviornments. 

For instance when I offer 1000$ to a friend in dire need of money...they can&#39;t take it from me because they know im black and that they experience priveledge so it would be unethical based on the racial theory they are holding.

 _16-Nov-21 03:02 PM_:

Hi Gravitons! I&#39;m curious if there is a directory of available conflict facilitators coming out of this group? 
I&#39;m looking for people who have either actively facilitated multiple different conflicts, or are deeply trained in a specific modality.
Would be great to see names &amp; contact info next to the modality that facilitator practices.

Occasionally I need to recommend facilitators that aren&#39;t me &amp; I&#39;d like to have a phonebook of who I can call upon.

(ps: didn&#39;t mean to post this while a class session &amp; some really important reactions are happening... it was just coincidence. hope i&#39;m not taking away from the focus at hand. I&#39;ll make this a thread so that the replies don&#39;t distract)

 _23-Nov-21 09:18 AM_:

oh... ü§î  Today in the last session of the training i was thinking to take 10 minutes to talk about the POAPs, making sure everyone was able to claim all their POAPs

but @ryeder (they/them) is right, if all links have been claimed maybe there have been some people claiming them without coming to the sessions

i am going to make a review of the claims to make the list of the people that actually participated

What an interesting thing, some addresses hold 1500+ poaps on one wallet

today we will have live claiming on the session

but if a lot of participants couldn&#39;t claim maybe we could ask more links to the POAP team

Looks like there&#39;s a time window for claiming poaps.

You have had lots of people attending the Graviton training. Could you survey them about what they want to do next? Would that be a part of the next steps on a Tuesday?

üìå <em>the thought spiral</em>

A method I&#39;m pondering in regards to praise or gratitude practices...a weekly rotation where each member gets a new person in the community to praise each week.

How it could possibly be automated:
A bot that holds profiles for each community member maybe this looks like a photo, their working projects, the projects/daos etc. 

Then you can find the person you&#39;re praising in working threads or server maybe? 

These thoughts are in response to the natural habit of preferences developing when people gather and how inequalities can emerge from these habits habits if not accounted for. Same people praising the same people....

^^^ thoughts for rewards group. Curious what people here think. I feel like cultural practices and behavior is a good topic for jamming on?

One cultural practice that could help is online profiles, if folk wish to do that.

I agree entirely with you about projects people are working on, I see this as hugely helpful aligning with folk to buddy together, and form larger groups, or #clusters as they are known.

If I could find folk here working on similar projects, we could begin to start submitting smarter proposals, with greater speed, because many hands make light work.

And yes, there may be differences individually, but the Graviton Training will help us resolve those differences and find workable compromise.

Just wondering, @Juankbell , do the YouTube Graviton videos have either transcripts attached or synopses by time slice of topics covered?

Someone is interested but a bit daunted by the time requirement.

If not, could this be a task for a Graviton task force? I could transcribe for one video, but don&#39;t fancy doing all ten!

Also, is there an agenda for discussion this coming Tuesday evening (UK time), assuming the plan for Tuesday evenings is still to continue meeting?

 _01-Dec-21 04:55 AM_:

Thanks for yesterday, @Juankbell .

Great point about making progress between meetings, which often is easier for me than attending in person.

It was great to hear @chuygarcia.eth offer Comms support, which would certainly help in terms of the YouTube Graviton transcripts. I&#39;m happy to do at least some of grunt work, but would definitely appreciate some polish, my writing is not the most gifted!

Is Otter an option to get the basic scripts from YouTube? Other software also works, I&#39;m not prescriptive, given the UX is relatively intuitive.

And then I can write some synopses to add to the YouTube videos.

I&#39;m still learning about protocols here, and folks&#39; working patterns, so please suggest how you want to proceed, Juan.

@ALOYSIOUS , I think you might be interested, maybe in joining in with a bit of weaving? Or at least observing and commenting, I value your views as well.

Hey @Juankbell !

1) I presume we are meeting tonight?

I&#39;ve done some research / work mean time, testing out Otter against the G2S1 session in YouTube. So far I have transcribed the first half hour.

Once I have transcripts we can produce synopses.

If more people are involved producing transcripts, we can get the job done sooner!

Just a thought.

FYI @chuygarcia.eth 

2) Second, Juanke, I am inviting someone into TEC where I have noted an online dispute spilling over into Twitter &amp; the DAOist Server.

This seems quite a complicated dispute, so I feel some experienced Gravitons would be best assessing the case. I am happy to be involved, but nervous if my first case isn&#39;t quite a simple one, and have synchronous UK evening limits that I feel will curtail my contribution. I think technical expertise will be needed, for sure.

FYI @durgadas 

Let me know what I can do next.

The ‚Äúpower‚Äù lies within the words we use. 
Understanding this and implementing acquired wisdom makes our voice non violent.

We need to learn about autonomy / consent
We need to have a collective understanding of boundaries as they apply to consent
This will influence folx understanding of parameters

And then we can talk about parameters . . .
And perhaps the fact that everyone learns differently and some people will need 1:1 support to ensure inclusivity.

 _07-Dec-21 02:34 PM_:

So, my Virtuous Cycles tries to recognize the push/pull of doing and taking time for ourselves. Withdrawing and giving consent to use of certain amounts of time for this or for that. In many ways, it aligns with /r/antiwork on Reddit, in the sense that we need to be aware of HOW much we&#39;ve turned into colonizers of our own time. In many ways, our own efforts in TEC or other communities is an attempt to find a way to be fiscally free enough to have more autonomy of our time. This Faustian bargain is one we must be aware of in order to change society.

Thank you for your consideration . I can perhaps construct a guideline on how to do this, suitable for a smal Graviton group, but I wonder where it would fit in with the Graviton content base.

My Faustian contract is in two parts, BTW. Firstly my age, I want to help as much as possible while I am still able. Secondly I am concerned that folk will derail the DAO movement, for all those commercial and time based reasons, and that timely response to this is important, to show there is another path.

Lifting above the heated debate is important, but also good enough communication to show this is not in a detached way. That&#39;s a challenge for me, and where I would look to skilled comnunicators for support.

Apologies I could not attend yesterday, but a quick update on the Graviton Series 2 YT videos.

I&#39;ve transcribed forty minutes of G2S1, using Otter.ai, and  proof read and tidied 25 minutes.

The proof reading isn&#39;t quick work.

Once the proof reading is done, I can use copy.ai in a burst - it&#39;s only free for a trial period - to get synopses that can be used for the videos.

I will then put everything in a Google folder for folk to take a look.

But it could take a while.

FYI @durgadas

There are times, though, and some people, where this isn&#39;t possible, do you agree?

@Mettodo 

Hey there Gravitons, wishing you all a sweet start to 2022! 

Gravity has been working over the winter to help Gravity grow into its next iteration. We are submitting for funding this month to expand our services and options for participation as Gravitons! And there are some super sweet paid roles for us to opt into. 

A reminder of our working calls are on Tuesdays at 11am PST/8pm CET and practice calls are Thursdays at 12pm PST/9pm CET. You can find us at these times in the #gravity Working Group Voice Channel.

Now is a great time to get synched up with the work Gravity is doing. We need all of our skill sets and experience to build out a super solid future for Gravity. 

Please react below with your favorite emoji so we know who&#39;s tracking Gravity&#39;s growth üåà

Looking forward to seeing you all soon!

And then folk may ask, and Gravitons can explain what it&#39;s all about.

 _11-Jan-22 01:35 AM_:

Had a look, thanks.

I guess I can&#39;t vote on or suggest activities, I don&#39;t have that kind of voting power.

Back in the day, I was a project manager, I took a process / functional view, rather than Kanban, with a much better than average success rate.

There must be a discussion space where tasks are discussed, or is that always a group meeting in person? Or maybe folk can submit proposals?

As a process designer, I also knew that best processes start with and stay focused on desired outcomes. So my project plans were effectively task breakdowns of process flow diagrams: start with the required outcome, and design backwards to ensure necessary inputs are completed and provided.

Maybe that happens behind Kanbans here.

So, summarising, I&#39;m definitely interested, and for a start keen to find the discussion space where activities are put forward, designed and voted on.

Maybe that&#39;s a Kanban task to add?

Maybe another is community builder? I&#39;ve done that task twice, now, it&#39;s no small task ...

 _11-Jan-22 01:47 AM_:

BTW, as a project manager, for every project there&#39;s typically a kick off meeting.

At that meeting, we would talk about the end goal, so folk we were asking to contribute knew what we were aiming at, and could decide whether they were opting in. It&#39;s effectively a sales process.

We need that same focus for Gravitons, so they have the incentive to come and use their skills, not just claim they&#39;ve been on a course.

So, actually, we are seeking to build three levels of Gravitons.

Certificated Gravitons, Apprentice Gravitons, Active Gravitons.

I should mention I was also an EdTech co founder for five years, I look to help other folk grow and progress! I&#39;m also a life long learner, and dedicated career long innovator. So personal and organisational growth for all has always been part of my heart.

Happy to discuss this further, any aspect.

 _11-Jan-22 12:27 PM_:

Right now there are two main branches, 1 for conflict management services and 1 for trust creation and training activities, I think that if the roles don&#39;t fit or if you think that there should be a bounty created for an activity we are not taking into account, please write that in the feedback part of the google form or lets talk about by PMs or in todays call, i think that bounties should adapt to the skills and necessities we identify collectively. The thing about half a job is really because we want people to have active roles and involvement in other activities, but also one person can apply to several bounties to increase the amount of work and retribution from Gravity. Also bounties are really modest as we are initializing and bootstrapping the project, but i hope that we can increase rates as the project grows üôÇ

The Conflict Management is a sticking plaster, the Trust Building vitamins. Typically people reach first for sticking plasters.

Supporting all conflicts could be very heavy. Can we not set a maximum, so that Bounty support kicks in after a certain number?

I could suggest two books for a book reading club if there is time and space  üôÇ: 
(1) Inside the No, 5 steps to decisions that last, by Myrna Lewis. She talks about how to mine the gold in conflict and looks into using all voices in the space. With very practical apporach (using diversity) 
(2) Leadership and new science. Discovering order in a chaotic world, by Margaret Wheatly. My personal guru. She is amazing on how she describes the disruption of what she calls &#39;Newton&#39; organisations and the formation of new, quantum, organic ones, like DAO&#39;s, and what that means for leadership, the importance of relationship. Absolutely brilliant.

Response times in Discord are different, and there&#39;s a bigger emphasis on showing up in person.

So I think you are onboard now, if you attended the Graviton meeting just now?

We are both squad members!

 _26-Jan-22 05:58 AM_:

So about content creation, @Juankbell ...

We could follow the example of the rewards community, and host a cross-DAO discussion meeting, writing up conclusions afterwards in Medium.

Topics could be:

1) The need for community in Web 3
2) Creating generative communities
3) Community evidenced disputes eg Satoshi or not Satoshi, fake news, shit coins etc
4) Dispute resolution techniques
5) The work of Elinor Ostrom
6) The perceived value of dispute resolution

This would give the Graviton community an immediate presence, and give us wider community material to work on to help us shape our efforts.

I am in plenty of WhatsApp communities who would likely come to listen.

Love to hear your thoughts!

Should we not also consider our monitoring? What our success metrics might look like, and over what period?

 _03-Feb-22 01:10 AM_:

I&#39;m wondering, from the coordination angle, whether a spreadsheet could help, holding frequent questions like this one, and curate a Notion where folk can add answers as they come across them?

Answers could be crowd sourced, and then @Zeptimus can check answers to ensure accuracy and validity, rather than respond to many queries on the same subject. If each question had a like function/emoji, or a window to the original question showing the populatity, we could see which questions needed answers the most.

Would this help?

Discord isn&#39;t great for this, because even with channels, there&#39;s a huge volume of discussion flowing past like the Mississippi!

Notion could also work, adding Discord handles to a question.

Hi ComVor!

I have tried to construct a lightning version FAQ page based on your question, along with other questions here.

Would you please have a look and see if it is a) accessible and navigable, and b) at least in part answers your question? And I need to give you a starting point, you are asking a Learning Curve start position of #Orientation, and you will see a table when you follow the link that I hope will start explaining.

[Graviton FAQ Resources](https://www.notion.so/Graviton-FAQ-Resources-37309732b1304df59335b6c4ff83aef8) 

Your feedback will help tune this resource, which I believe can be useful towards community building, a topic I suspect Gravity and Gravitons care deeply about.

 _05-Feb-22 09:23 AM_:

Okay, just had a chance to look over this. Thanks again for putting this together @innov8tor3.  

I think this format is useful and I like the different roles for filtering where you are on the learning curve and how that maps to your DAO graphic. 

The Gravity Leaning Curve page feels someone too abstract for someone, like myself, at the &#39;Orientation&quot; stage. I think what I&#39;d be interested in at this point of the curve is information that will help me move from the orientation point to the pathway point. Figuring out what all the pathways into Gravity are. I think that would involve including some high level overviews of the type of work that the gravity working group does and how it conceptually sees itself (diagrams of structure, what it aims to do, how it relates to Ostrom&#39;s principles, and what avenues there are to move into the earning point in the learning curve flow). 

The information currently in the learning curve notion page seems more oriented towards someone in the &quot;Initiate&quot; point of the learning curve flow (how to setup proposals, funding bid and status process, task creation).

Hope that&#39;s helpful feedback

‚ù§Ô∏è 

Maybe also worth embedding the DAO graphic from your tweet into the notion page in order to immediately see how the different learning curve categories relate to each other?

 _08-Feb-22 09:50 AM_:

hello everyone who had the questions regarding praise and TEC for voting. The praise is rewarded in TEC, but the rewards system still hasn&#39;t made the first distribution after the hatch, they will be working on a retroactive list of praise divided by rounds until we reach the present time. So in brief, for each praise you get, you will receive certain amount of TEC in a period of time.

I hope to see you all today! i will share the doodle for setting our weekly activities, and also will be presenting myself for the coordination manager role. I think its something i have been doing so far and i could do a good work in this new phase of structuring Gravity

Hi @LBrian ...

In theory you are already in the right place. Several of us have been through training to be conflict mediators, but I&#39;m not sure what our engagement process is currently. The best person to start with is @Juankbell who is now coordinating effort here.

It might help to spare us any names and details, but give an idea about what you are looking for.

 _09-Feb-22 10:40 AM_:

Hi @innov8tor3 thanks for response and the invitation to share some details on what is going on in our community. Here is a quick breakdown. 

Our community needs an impartial third party to manage disputes between a few members, myself included. We have tried to direct disputes into a private dispute resolution channel, but our community is so small right now that the people in conflict end up mediating their own dispute resolution process. This is inevitably put us back at square one, where we have been for months. 
The disputes tend to focus around the same one or two individuals. I won&#39;t speak on their behalf or try and diagnose the issue here in a public channel without them here as well. But I think it&#39;s fair to say that both parties aren&#39;t willing to budge, each side sees the other side as the issue. 
Over the last 2 days discussion has really broken down, and it&#39;s beginning to get a bit ugly. We are in the the middle of requesting funding and a handful of channels have been occupied by these conflicts which is not a good look. These disputes are not only dividing the community and halting work but in my opinion, they are now beginning to a effect our ability to fund our initiatives.

Also, can we drop in the process for claiming POAPs? Since newbies like me typically don&#39;t know the claiming process, or that there&#39;s a short claiming window.

You are on our collective radar, L Brian!

 (@Juankbell , please step in when you are ready.)

I&#39;m sure you know, L Brian, that dispute resolution can take time, both parties need to be willing to resolve. ü§ù Do we know this is the case? Also, is the dispute bipartite or more multi dimensioned? 2Ô∏è‚É£, 3Ô∏è‚É£, 4Ô∏è‚É£ ...

And what are your timescales please? We need to locate resources and ask for their availability.

Sorry, one other question. The conditions for the dispute may give rise to future disputes, ‚úÖ or ‚ùå?

We would recommend after any üî• that a 
üë©
‚Äçüöí prevention officer would be very useful!

Can you indicate whether that would be useful, if we can address the üî•?

 _10-Feb-22 08:35 AM_:

Thank you all so much!! @Juankbell has reached out to me and shared first steps.

I&#39;m in the process of attempting to get full buy in from the group of 4-5.
It is multi dimensional, though one person is involved in all of the disputes thus far. 

Timescales meaning how much time do we have to resolve this? If that&#39;s the case then we are hoping to resolve this as quickly as possible because it is effecting our ability to work (we are all currently volunteers). I&#39;m aware that &quot;quick&quot; in this case could be weeks +. 

‚úÖ  The conditions for the dispute are could very likely lead to future disputes. Though I think everyone is trying to resolve this so we can move on. Cooperation hasn&#39;t been 100% yet.

A prevention Officer sounds like helpful resource to have following the dispute. 

**Before you allocate too much time to our dispute I would like to get buy in from the rest of the group**
. If I can&#39;t get everyone on board I don&#39;t want to have wasted anyone&#39;s time here. I truly appreciate the assistance that you have already offered. 

@Naberius I want you to feel free to chime in if I miss anything here. Naberius has been helping build out a dispute resolution process in our DAO.

Hey everyone!

I&#39;ve put together an outline for a permanent pinned post here in gravity, covering the status of all our tasks, so visitors can see what we are doing at a glance, and enquire further if they need to.

@Juankbell review the document for any changes needed? I hope there are no surpises. Then you guys can decide on format and gloss, which I know I am very poor at.  Nuts and bolts is more my domain, but I love your creatives! A plus point is it is one page A4 for now, but up against the limits!

@Juankbell , if you comment on this document, about what you want to see in the Medium article, maybe we can talk about that, so we can move sooner rather than later?

It&#39;s possible to create events in Discord, but I haven&#39;t tried. Maybe ask this in the next Coordinators meeting?

Just thinking in a brochure format, @Leen , could we see the purpose of the two Practice Sessions on a front page, like we would see on a glossy brochure, detailing what the course does, who would be looking for it and perhaps why?

An A4 one page version of that makes it pretty easy to promote your sessions in Twitter.

(Did we decide we were thinking about using Twitter?)

Tool is called ‚Äòcheck in wave‚Äô - soft way to deep listen and start sensing what is present in the group

We do a small intro to Deep Democracy and liberating structures, but we dive a lot deeper into that in session of 22/02 (with of course some cool interactive tools)

Hey, @BiancaGadelha !

I can&#39;t attend the coordinators meeting today, could you raise the subject of the permanent pinned post, please? You saw it some days back I think.

I need to know what to do to take it the next step, who needs to agree it, whether @acidlazzer needs to see it yet, all those good things.

Would you look after it for me, and let me know what I need to do next?

Thanks!

> Hey everyone!

I&#39;ve put together an outline for a permanent pinned post here in gravity, covering the status of all our tasks, so visitors can see what we are doing at a glance, and enquire further if they need to.

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJntp5OLoRaChRA77PRsITyAEQK3Nq4u-nGXMancIgk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJntp5OLoRaChRA77PRsITyAEQK3Nq4u-nGXMancIgk/edit?usp=sharing) 

@Juankbell review the document for any changes needed? I hope there are no surpises. Then you guys can decide on format and gloss, which I know I am very poor at.  Nuts and bolts is more my domain, but I love your creatives! A plus point is it is one page A4 for now, but up against the limits!

@Juankbell , if you comment on this document, about what you want to see in the Medium article, maybe we can talk about that, so we can move sooner rather than later?

Wanted to share something with Gravity to get a better feel for what you all think. There&#39;s an interesting video series called &quot;Awakening from the Meaning Crisis&quot; by John Vervaeke. The series is his attempt at reconciling cognitive science with spirituality in an effort to create a set of practices to that would foster a culture that could effectively address the multiple existential threats humanity faces. He doesn&#39;t get into the practices as much in this series, it&#39;s more of a scientific and philosophical justification for the project.  Anyway if enough people are. interested, I&#39;d like to start a discussion group. Check it out a let me know what you think!

Howdy gravity! I have a couple of thoughts I wanted to drop in the channel for feedback and so I don&#39;t forget them before tomorrow morning.

I dropped into the SanghaDAO server to introduce myself. Ended up having a conversation with someone else who was new there as well. They have quite a bit of experience with solo meditation but also with circling and authentic relating. I&#39;m pretty new to all of these interpersonal practices so not fully aware of all the differences. Are these other interpersonal practices something we&#39;d want to start bringing in? Or maybe we can build those connections while focusing more of our energy toward building really solid infrastructure? Just wanted to see what the sentiment was with everyone participating in Gravity at the moment.

The chartered institute of personnel and development did some research in the early 2000s, noting that a third of mental health problems resulting in long-term absenteeism originated from the work place. Whereas two-thirds obviously then originated from outside work. Home can be a stressful place.

 _02-Mar-22 11:33 AM_:

I agree with @jimscarver , isolation is a known problem, and how can we bring resources to that?

For some reason I can never hear @ALOYSIOUS , and I really want to!

There was a grouping of DAOs in Bankless DAO, @bends , it got to @ 250 DAOs, and then stopped, and I haven&#39;t looked for a while since then ... I didn&#39;t notice many looking at inclusion or mental health at that time. There was a recent get together on Twitter of ReFi DAOs, that could be a way to go ...

Good observation, although I think that these would end up being one and the same thing in practice because inclusivity and understanding of difference is crucial to succesful intervention.

 _02-Mar-22 12:25 PM_:

I would argue that, although I would be cautious about generalizing this too much. Causation is already something very hard to pin down. But from my perspective and from a theoretical standpoint I&#39;d say there are very closely tied together. It is only when I understood my own specific way of functioning in the world that I understood what actually helped me rather than trying hard with solutions that were highly ineffective (because they were taylored to people with different ways of functioning).

I hope this brick of text made sense ^ üôÉ

They have quite a bit of experience with solo meditation but also with circling and authentic relating. I&#39;m pretty new to all of these interpersonal practices so not fully aware of all the differences. Are these other interpersonal practices something we&#39;d want to start bringing in? Or maybe we can build those connections while focusing more of our energy toward building really solid infrastructure? Just wanted to see what the sentiment was with everyone participating in Gravity at the moment.

Hey hey, I&#39;m wondering if there exists outside of the Graviton training, a non-violent communication guide that I can share with people (other than the book itself). The reason why I&#39;m asking for a quicker digest guide, is that I am trying to decrease the energy/time cost of joining 0mega, while still creating the opportunity to learn. Book/hours long vid = costly, guide = less costly. I will direct people to here of course to encourage further learning. 

Also is there an official (consistent) list of people who are open to being reached out to if a member encounters any problems, or a form that someone can fill in so that they can get help? I&#39;ve seen them around/heard of them, I think, but would love official links/list that I can include in 0mega onboarding. Thank you üôè

@Jeremy&amp;TheGospelOfChange I got to thinking after the meeting (I had to leave early) about these topics related to Consent. Perhaps you can comment: [Thoughts On Consent Draft 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xnH5lI4iHESQNXGyaeBd8hGCUGoiuEcD5uZ4-vSWOoU/edit?usp=sharing)

**Who do we choose to be?**

In her latest book Margaret Wheatley (now 75) helps us find out where to put our efforts, what to work on, in a collapsing system. And she does it, as always, in a most extraordinary way. Backed by a ton of nature science and historical insights, and a life time of holding spaces and organising communities, she takes you on a path to discover where we can be most useful. 

The book has 8 chapters. It reads like a train and is very accessible. 
Tomorrow we launch the book, and see how we want to organise ourselves.
We meet in the Graviton Voice Channel at 9:00 pm CET

Hope to see you there!

 _09-Mar-22 11:58 AM_:

A key thing to bear in mind with any health advice - eg Psychology - is the Do No Harm mantra. Mental health is a very difficult area, it&#39;s very hard to provide good support.

So it may still be that professionals are needed, in certain situations. That moment of handoff is something to be clear on and to know as far as possible when to trigger.

Is this an ethical objection? Or a usability objection?

Folks, I have a personal contact in Facebook, Jo Berry, whose father, a serving British MP, was killed by an IRA extremist. She subsequently made peace with him, and has devoted her life work to peace initiatives since then.

I&#39;m thinking a Zoom session with skilled people here testing ideas with her, exploring joint opportunities with her, looking to build collaboration now or in the future.

Branding this with the Gravity DAO label could be good PR for us, and help underpin the Gardens bid.

What do we think?

When it comes to practicing to use 
Liberating Structures,
what qualities, traits and characteristics
would make learning easier? 

an open mind

frequency of practice

theoretical frame

purpose

some pressure/spotlight

teaching it myself

a slow pace

safe group to practice

How is it that we have an open mind and games and interaction at the same time?

> Folks, I have a personal contact in Facebook, Jo Berry, whose father, a serving British MP, was killed by an IRA extremist. She subsequently made peace with him, and has devoted her life work to peace initiatives since then.

I&#39;m thinking a Zoom session with skilled people here testing ideas with her, exploring joint opportunities with her, looking to build collaboration now or in the future.

Branding this with the Gravity DAO label could be good PR for us, and help underpin the Gardens bid.

What do we think?

(Google &quot;TED talk Jo Berry&quot;, you should find her!)

 _16-Mar-22 08:55 AM_:

Good question, I think I see what you are aiming for now.

Easier learning is a great goal for anyone, and much needed in any DAO.

It&#39;s fascinating to me to see the difference between folk who can learn for themselves, natural explorers I tend to call them, versus folk who need that bit more guidance and road markings ...

FYI, I was a co-founder on an EdTech startup for five years, and acquired some knowledge in this area during that time.

Education can often be very rigid, difficult to move forward, and in my mind clearly needs Liberating Structures to move forward from the old 19th century model so many still use.

 _16-Mar-22 03:06 PM_:

I will recommend these evaluations based on the PERMA model

PERMA model [PERMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK6K_N2qe9Y)

> Professor Martin Seligman discusses his foirmula for wellbeing: PERMA

The Workplace PERMA Profile is created by the same authors as the individual PERMA Profiler, but it is designed to assess groups and organizations.

Leaders can use this to assess workers or teams and improve wellbeing in the environment, which will lead to better performance.

Workplace PERMA Profile [https://www.peggykern.org/uploads/5/6/6/7/56678211/workplace_perma_profiler_102014.pdf](https://www.peggykern.org/uploads/5/6/6/7/56678211/workplace_perma_profiler_102014.pdf) 

The PERMA Profiler is an extensive questionnaire from the University of Pennsylvania that assesses each of Seligman‚Äôs (2012) components of wellbeing or flourishing.

This can be an excellent resource to assess clients as they progress through therapy, coaching, or interventions in positive psychology or counseling. [https://www.peggykern.org/uploads/5/6/6/7/56678211/the_perma-profiler_101416.pdf](https://www.peggykern.org/uploads/5/6/6/7/56678211/the_perma-profiler_101416.pdf) 

This one is online, therefore individuals can send us their results and we can create groups of people based on different group characteristics. This PURPOSE+ PERMA Profiler is a quick online assessment that asks relevant questions related to each component of PERMA.

It is a fast and efficient way to assess and compare levels of wellbeing. It will email the results directly to you and compares your PERMA scores with other people in the same demographic. The questions asked in the short survey also provide a great starting point for therapy, coaching, or consulting.

im not familiar with banks but maybe you can bridge it to binance smart chain (using [https://bridge.connext.network/](https://bridge.connext.network/)  ) and to binance exchange from there and then to ur bank

 _17-Mar-22 06:08 PM_:

binance doesn&#39;t work on the US I believe üòÑ  maybe they can do the same but with Coinbase

If Coinbase doesn&#39;t allow BSC deposits you can bridge them to polygon instead

even binance does (though just for matic and usdc)

I earned some $Bank a while back, and I can see the exchange rate on Coin Market Cap.

That means one or more exchanges is giving a price.

Also works for xDAI, therefore we should be able to track down an exchange platform for xDAI this way?

Hey there gravitrons . Seeking a Gravitron to help with a conflict. Two people in power positions have decided to use their power to exclude me from groups they are moderators of. But the reasons are that I spoke up on behalf of my needs and against some harmful language against women and autistic people. I suspect that they are retaliating against me and saying that their whole organization agrees with them but I suspect it‚Äôs localized to them. Personal vendetta, abuse of power

I already was invited to a retreat and bought tickets and was involved in the onboarding. 2 weeks before the event they write a letter (together) saying my application has been denied due to ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù

Other people in the retreat don‚Äôt know what the problem is about, never heard about it.

Don‚Äôt want to say more here in your working group chat, however, if anyone is suitable to help with this we are in need of someone with proper training.

@alpine.lines thank you for naming your take on identity. its so hard to listen to people talk about identity as if it needs to be validated from others..i know from my oppression that this is the goal of the powers that be.

 _24-Mar-22 03:40 PM_:

the reason people struggle with identity is because of the existence of democracy and schools.

 power /caste systems were socially designed to erase our identity. were confused because we think we went to schools to learn we wont admit as a society that schools are really just residential schools still, they just started naming these residential schools after white people and towns.

**Aloysious Update //**

I&#39;ve had my head down with my home community transitioning from core member governed project and financed by a research lab to open source and request based $$$ with a limited budget. This has sucked up a lot of time and emotional labor. It&#39;s starting to wrap up. whew

I have also been supported in my own social experiment within ParadigmStates to work on **Authentic Relating**
.  I have begun offering relating sessions where I get to put my acquired and developed skills to the test to bringing people closer to thier authentic selves. 
I work with people on internal to external conflicts,  trauma / shadow work / decolonization and identity reclamation.

My sense of security has not been in tact and I have had to figure out how to keep the lights on after my source of income for the past year stopped being an option. I am hoping to tune in with some more intention, I&#39;m not in the clear financially and that&#39;s the only thing that keeps me from attending all of our meetings.

 _30-Mar-22 12:24 PM_:

my two cents as a returning graviton // I would like to see a workshop on **consent**
[boundaries] in the training because that&#39;s one of the most important pieces to relating with others and were not offering such material in the community. -Lux Gypsum attended a few classes last season they are a facilitator and one of the best on the content in my experience. I could ask if they are available to teach a session. This is the reason i do not contribute more at the projects, people lack the communication skills to navigate boundaries and consent [this is where conflict comes from], I fail to experience/ have access to autonomy in spaces where boundaries are not advocated for or understood.

> [Consent as an Awareness Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPM8ZYmZMLo)
I&#39;m interested in Morgan Vanderpool teaching **decolonization**
 the next go around. They&#39;re a graviton and an instructor on the content anywho.
> Anti-oppression and activism health and action w| Morgan Vanderpool, LICSW 

> Recording of workshop from 1/26/22.

We discuss what consent is and how we can cultivate a broader awareness of consent in ourselves, our relationships, and our culture.

I&#39;ve even built a simple POC for a political LinkedIn that includes ways for governments to make data generated during the administration of law public and transparent along with tools to allow everyday civilians to analyze it and participate in that discourse. I think pairing people with opposing political views who are identified by an ml/deep learning algo as likely to be cordial and engage in meaningful and fruitful discourse would be an incredible opportunity even the existing social platforms should consider implementing.

problem with implementing with existing social platforms is that there is no financial incentive for the platform. such an exciting area to develop though!

yes indeed! in general, OSINT and social systems / behavioral systems are extremely interesting. The algos that go into that kinda stuff can be massive undertakings in of themselves. To think of really deploying something like that as a standalone platform is certainly a challenge, but... it can be done üòÄ

We dive into decision making tonight in the practice group! We experiment with adding this question after the consent has been reached: we heard your concern, we heard your &#39;no-voice&#39;. What do you need to come along with the final decision?

Would be amazing if we could test decision making on a real issue. Personal, or in the TEC community. Something we can practice on!

 _05-Apr-22 07:33 AM_:

Hey Leen. What time is the group tonight? 4pm UK time I can make, but I&#39;m out later.

Would this be an interesting problem?

The TEC community are now rating praise, and in some cases folk are praising themselves.

As a Brit, and of my generation, it&#39;s not something I&#39;m comfortable doing, and I definitely won&#39;t be praising myself any time soon. Isn&#39;t value something that can only be measured by others?

As someone in the quant team, I can decide to either accept a community norm,  vote with my feet and leave the quant group, or raise an issue with other group members. None of these options are very appealing.

More detail on this, many folk in communities are in favour of bigging themselves up, often with less than helpful results. One tactic is to avoid such folk, but that&#39;s not very community oriented.

A counter strategy here can be getting to know folk better and allowing them to continue with their largess, but having live awareness of the tendency. Yet I have another principle, about honesty, telling the truth, and also about  all of us needing to learn in situations where it&#39;s clear we need to.

So I have regular decisions to make in these situations. It would be lovely to make clearer decisions, perhaps better able to juggle my competing values, and maybe even bringing in new values to use in these circumstances.

Hope this helps!

Hi Gravitons! üëã   üòÅ 

I&#39;m just getting to know TEC and feel inspired so far. Was referred to Gravity by @bendsvia SanghaDAO. I have 5+ years experience leading **Relational Arts**
 practices  (<em>Authentic Relating, Circling</em>) with groups and individuals.

It&#39;s so good to see that y&#39;all have identified **empathy**
 as a key to success in conflict resolution. Empathy is not something that came easy for me. IME, it takes a lot of time and energy to build that muscle of Showing Up consistently, especially when folks are triggered in a relational space. üíõ 

I really want Gravity to succeed. So I&#39;m offering my time freely to any of you who&#39;d like to practice your **relational awareness &amp; empathy skills**
 with me. üí™  HMU on Calendly and please reach out with questions. [https://calendly.com/ecotexan-stephen/zoom-call](https://calendly.com/ecotexan-stephen/zoom-call) 

If you&#39;d like to get a taste for these practices, I lead Interpersonal Meditation for the Monastic Academy Virtual Zendo every Friday at 1pm ET. Also Free.

 _16-Apr-22 03:53 AM_:

Hey y&#39;all!

I have a community building thought and question set, if okay to ask folks here.

TLDR:

1Ô∏è‚É£ I dropped into Helium, where they have a sizable Telegram community, 31k, and are getting a lot of spamming.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Looking at their price performance, I&#39;m wondering about systems to help community members stay secure, maybe a reputation system for members so other members can tell who they are dealing with.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Maybe this could be based on praise offered, even quite specific praise subsets, we of course could extend the TEC tooling to other DAOs, and spamming is such a nuisance.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Helium have a useful business model, hot spot building; they have a #49 rating on coin market cap, @ $2.5bn, so this clearly works to a degree ...
5Ô∏è‚É£ I wonder if anyone has done any research into the damage spamming brings to community functionality, thinking about any knock on effect, how exchange price is effected. I&#39;m thinking good money will be diverted from good projects into rather more dubious projects
6Ô∏è‚É£ Strikes me Helium could be a good place to try an external project for TEC, I sense there may be an opportunity there, maybe even an offshoot DAO opportunity.
7Ô∏è‚É£ I had this same issue in a FB group where I Admin. It&#39;s smaller, only 12K, but spam levels now are enough for me to want to find a better solution, and Web 2 folk might be okay to try new tech if they could earn &quot;reputation points&quot;.
8Ô∏è‚É£ Hope it&#39;s therefore okay to ask specific people if üÖ∞ Ô∏è they have knowledgeable contacts in Helium,  üÖ± Ô∏è they think this is a good idea.

A final thought, does it fit with any other current TEC plans? Maybe it fits as a community building initiative, which I understand even to be part of the Gravity bag here.

So I&#39;ll tag some folks, sorry if that&#39;s bad etiquette ...

Super excited for today&#39;s call! Want to see you all again, it seems like a long time without sharing. There has been some advance in the Graviton training study plan and the slides we are preparing.

As @MorganicMovement &#127812; suggested, today we will vote to decide if we can have a consent on the starting dates being the 10th of May. Also, its something that i dont like but we might need to be on top of some of the facilitators to place their content in the following days.

I think we could have a deadline that if missed by the facilitator, can be passed to other facilitator who has more availability.

Looking at the Integration/Roles tab, do we need to include Active Gravitons to support the Dispute Resolution service?

These roles are important, typically needing the ability to move between DAOs and represent Gravity! Recruiting for these roles in Gravity will be important, IMO.

I feel like there&#39;s a whole research arm you can be leading on this!

> So each training has its own practice group, I get it. Thanks for clarifying. I&#39;m trying to orient my self about the activities.
For now what I have gathered is:
I wait for the training to start and if it is aligned with my time zone, I participate.
I can go if I can to the psychology research meeting.

Am I missing something?

 _29-Apr-22 02:29 AM_:

This is absolutely awesome!

I need this myself right now, several aspects, and I&#39;m keen to discuss a new idea about this next Wednesday!

In brief, Gravity could do an intro to the LS topic / course, recorded, put on YouTube, and available in longer form to other DAOs maybe on a Crypto Swap basis if they have an established quoted currency eg on Coin Market Cap. Meaning they invest in TEC, using their own currency, which would show demand for TEC / Gravity services and increase perceived value in TEC / Gravity. Lots to discuss about that if folk want to take that direction.

I&#39;d love to get some feedback, @Jeremy&amp;TheGospelOfChange ...

 _04-May-22 07:02 AM_:

Hi @BiancaGadelha, I finally found some time to go through the questionary you shared during the last Gravity meeting, thanks!. Although I find it a very good starting point for the work you described, I find it somehow weak specially in the last part (work/life balance, too vague) and in measuring personal health. Imho, working in a DAO, which means spending a lot of time in front of a laptop (maybe at home, alone) could be alienating and pose some serious health risk (because of the sedentary lifestyle and continuous exposure to blue light). I also would assess variables such as how often dao workers meet people in &quot;real&quot; life, the amount and quality of sleep, the amount of physical activity, BMI.... Also a test to measure concentration ability would be useful. I really enjoyed the call and I appreciate your work and the activity of the Gravity team. Healthy life style, good diet, physical activity, meditation, self and mutual help, support groups, 1to1 coaching sessions, should all be encouraged inside Daos. I hope I will be able to give a valuable contribute üí™

Hey @BiancaGadelha 

I did a quick view on what LS might look like outside Gravity, based on the slides, and maybe this could be a discussion about next steps for LS.

Do let me know if it&#39;s a reasonable understanding, and maybe it could be base for a Gravity product that other DAOs will see value in.

OR as Juan was discussing, if it could be usefuil inside mediation processes ... 

For me, on bounties, for our Gravity agenda and planning, I&#39;d love to help create a product catalogue for Gravity, which would help folk visiting other DAOs knowing what Gravity can offer, and perhaps even who to get in touch with ... It will probably still need someone to provide some gloss in the digital graphics and marketing, of course!

I suspect others are also looking at the leadership elements we have noted here in <span class="mention">#&#128330;ÔΩúgravity.

 _10-May-22 05:57 AM_:

Yep, I had a look at that survey, it&#39;s an excellent starting point!I find it a little bit lacking  though in the &quot;individual&quot; section. All the points are somehow focused in the relation between the person and the Dao, but it doesn&#39;t seem to me that it takes notes of the individual in itself. I believe an healthy Dao is made of healthy people (in their individual lives not only  in the aspects work-related) and this should be considered. But still, that survey is a very good model, strong structure. What data have you already collected?

Agreed! And our intention is to focus more on the individual and then provide a mental care, but yeah that&#39;s a good model to start and it was applied on DAOs so it&#39;s very interesting.

 _11-May-22 11:00 AM_:

Hello everyone! yes, we meet today, although i am not feeling very well so i propose to end a little bit earlier the call, taking 30 to 45 mins

the topics of the agenda are: Graviton training poaps, Graviton training coordination, talking about the website, and talking about organizational development

<h3>innov8tor3 <img src="![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/530682470232883210/193353ccfcbc44b9892dbb7a5862c455.png)" width="25" height="25" /></h3>

 _11-May-22 11:23 AM_:

Other people&#39;s money, when we are responsible, @Juankbell , can make us focus more, but can be a burden to carry.

I forgot to say about spreading risk: don&#39;t put all our eggs in one basket, and don&#39;t invest more than we can afford to lose ...

We don&#39;t ever lose who we are as a person, or our wonderful contacts. Investments can go down as well as up.

Gravity need to develop products, and be able to see need for those products in other DAOs ...

Suggestions for risk management in Crypto markets, given recent sharp falls:

1Ô∏è‚É£ The people involved are still involved. Their value doesn&#39;t change, there is a bedrock value there, whatever the current price. Key people leaving is something to watch for, though.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Spread risk across different currencies, including fiat
3Ô∏è‚É£ Many tech stocks experience boom, bust, steady growth, with speculators contributing to boom and bust. Can we find the steady builders in the attaching crypto communities? Is there a believable roadmap towards steady growth? And can we then invest time and energy towards steady growth?
4Ô∏è‚É£ All stock reflects underlying value, to some extent. Knowing the underlying value helps us see stock worth hanging on to.
5Ô∏è‚É£ The phrase &quot;Do Your Own Research&quot; was never so important!

I think I&#39;m saying that it would be helpful, since some of us (not certified &quot;psychologists&quot;) have been very much concerned with the psychology of DAOs and their participants, which is true due to the metamodern structure that is concerned with this overall as a fundamental thing

so not as someone looking to some bureaucracy or eduocracy but as fundamental to being metamodern itself, which I believe this DAO is a good example of, and I think is on the mind of almost everyone in Web3835017375405441064.png">

 _17-May-22 11:21 AM_:

I am glad you are here. I think everyone has gifts and tools to bring to this party.

I want to name that western medicine and people taught medicine **institutionally**
 pick up ableism and unrealistic/harmful biases via the curriculum. Its something that has to be unlearned over time. With some contributors like myself and durgadas who have been Advocates for people who are unable to get proper care from the medical systems or worse have been abused by them there&#39;s a heavy tone of decolonization that we carry everywhere we go. We know the sneaky harm that the medical industry causes. We try to speak to the shadows and nuances that people may not be tracking. Often we critique language because we grasp the weight of certain words and all thier context. If you are feeling uncomfortable or unwelcome because of tension when we speak about stuff I would understand that and I also want you to know that we want you here, we value your contributions. I&#39;m comfortable speaking monolithically about how good it is that you are here. Each person has a whole spectrum of insight to offer.  

I think it&#39;s important to name that planning around mental health can cause tension because the topic is so personal and loaded for each person attuned to these tragedies in our society. 

We are doing good work here. What I DONT want to see is mental health being a thing we do in the one month outta the year that people give a bleep. We gotta set up a permanent shop and make mental health a dominant factor in the grander scheme of things. Civilization depends on it. 

I can&#39;t express how excited I am that Bianca was able to push forward this group. I&#39;ve been flailing about naming mental health as why <s>daos</s> people are struggling more over the last year. I left the commons because it wasn&#39;t taking serious my complaints. I returned after a break and started to see mental health being taken more serious.

 _17-May-22 01:05 PM_:

I love this @ALOYSIOUS. 
My feeling is that we need to be aware that we&#39;ve outsourced NOT ONLY our fiscal lives, which we are trying to reclaim with cryptocurrencies but also SO MUCH OTHER STUFF, including our own mental health via a LOT of Appeals To Authority. 
So, in my view, agency and autonomy MUST exist at the core of DAO efforts about mental health, and I have concerns that this &quot;bringing psychologists to DAOs&quot; could end up with habits like the 4D&#39;s Of Disconnection:
1. Diagnosis (judgment, analysis, criticism, comparison)
2. Denial of Responsibility 
3. Demand 
4. &#39;Deserve&#39; oriented language 
and I&#39;d like to know what we can do to prevent this.

 _18-May-22 07:39 AM_:

I hope to make some sense with this reply ...

It may not be that you weren&#39;t heard, @ALOYSIOUS , but rather that folk don&#39;t have the tools or approaches to respond with. That can come across as stigmatic, but actually people can be quite helpless without tools to access the needs involved, and tools to make appropriate responses and suggestions. No response can be better than a scared, fearful OMG response!

It is precisely why, in my mind, the work we are doing here is so important. The digital world, Web 3, needs this, because Web 2 signally failed to grasp the problem properly. Working relationships were often toxic, with many instances of bullying and bigotry. That can also happen at home, see my response above. This is a clear opportunity to take steps forward, IMO.

My feeling is that we need to be aware that we&#39;ve outsourced NOT ONLY our fiscal lives, which we are trying to reclaim with cryptocurrencies but also SO MUCH OTHER STUFF, including our own mental health via a LOT of Appeals To Authority. 
So, in my view, agency and autonomy MUST exist at the core of DAO efforts about mental health, and I have concerns that this &quot;bringing psychologists to DAOs&quot; could end up with habits like the 4D&#39;s Of Disconnection:
1. Diagnosis (judgment, analysis, criticism, comparison)
2. Denial of Responsibility 
3. Demand 
4. &#39;Deserve&#39; oriented language 
and I&#39;d like to know what we can do to prevent this.

Do you think you are getting enough support from the Gravity community, because we don&#39;t want you getting burnout? I feel like I could do a bit more asynch, but I don&#39;t see much discussion / activity, usually, here in Discord, where I might be able to contribute some more.

Where are humans in such a setup?

Today&#39;s Gravity session summary:

Host: Bianca
Participants: Aloysious, bear100, Zeptimus, ddan, Incandenza, shanzz, durgadas

- Graviton training: Yesterday the presentation of the Third Graviton training was held. Feedbacks. Very good participation. Bianca underlines that only 29 on 36 participants downloaded the POAP. Aloysious will take care of keeping a register of the attendants from next meeting on. It&#39;s also been suggested to create a Linkedin page for Gravity Dao and a certificate that can be shared on Linkedin (besides the POAP)
- Update on the common prize: Gravity is second in the ranking, if anyone owns the token they can vote for us! Durgadas and Juan are preparing a video. 
- Everyone is invited to collaborate to the Gravity Commons Prize Script (Shared by Bianca)
- Reminder: this is mental health&#39;s month. We have the chance to talk about it. Angieberry has created an event to have a conversation about our mental journey. We want a safe and private space to talk about ourselves. We want to make this a monthly event. Appointment on Friday at 8am CST
- Recommended video: Gut Health in #web3, twitter talk on SunGens page (in Portuguese)
- Graviton training in Aragon&#39;s Umbrella initiative: it&#39;s going to be a graviton training specifically tailored on Aragon&#39;s needs. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the training plan on Aragon
- Question: how to share mental health resources? It&#39;s suggested to have a shared document where everyone can collaborate in order to have a wide spectrum knowledge through collaborative work. What about a medium post?
- Under Aloysious&#39; suggestion, Bianca created a shared document named &quot;Burnout Medium Post&quot;, everyone is welcome to contribute
- Durgadas is working on the website. Updates. Planning to have a specific meeting on Friday @ 11am PST, everybody is welcome!!!

Bianca: it&#39;s exciting to see all these things happening around Gravity and we are growing, thanks to the work we are putting on!

 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Commons prize - when does voting finish?
2Ô∏è‚É£ Aragon project - what is the Discord Server (permanent) link please?
3Ô∏è‚É£ Mental Health Resources - how about a dynamic library? A combination of Discord and Notion could be really helpful and easily kept up to date. A Medium post can discuss and direct folk further who are interested. I suggest @durgadas has the kind of curator mind that can help compile something like this

I think I can help you with that:

1Ô∏è‚É£  it ends on may 31st. You go here to vote: [https://snapshot.org/#/commonsstack.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/commonsstack.eth) 
2Ô∏è‚É£ This is Aragon&#39;s server link [https://discord.gg/pXqEVHuR](https://discord.gg/pXqEVHuR) 
3Ô∏è‚É£ I love that idea! @durgadas on that field. We were discussing about creating resources around Mental health where people has easy access to it, we need to brainstorm more that idea and work on it!

I hope it was helpful, let me know if there&#39;s something else you might need help with ü•∞   üåà

 _26-May-22 12:25 PM_:

Thanks that&#39;s brilliant!

Sorry to ask more questions ...

1Ô∏è‚É£ Does it cost to vote in snapshot? It seems only twelve people voted, and is the vote based on currency holdings based on the wallets shown? Also what currency do I need to be eligible to vote? 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Thanks for the Aragon server link!
3Ô∏è‚É£ Both Notion and Discord are easy to configure, maybe it&#39;s time for a Gravity Discord Server? If only to arrange library resources for access to folk visiting in Discord, meaning arranging materials according to particular channels, with discussion in each channel about how to organise materials. It will probably be good to discuss this some more, there are probably other ways to consider.

No problem, I&#39;m happy to help üôå  

1Ô∏è‚É£ You use your $TRUST. I believe you need to be a member of the Commons Stack, but I&#39;m not sure. Maybe @bends could help answering this question better then me üôè üèº  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Yeah of course üòâ  
3Ô∏è‚É£ I think the only difficulty around Discord is to the bot configuration, if someone could help with that we could totally put some more effort on it! And Notion is also great to get organized! For sure those are some topics to keep in mind and try to work on, I&#39;ll also bring it up on the next meeting üå±   Thank you!

It can get very confusing sometimes.
My solution was to add the TEC calendar to my google calendar, it automatically tells you the time in your time zone.
I turn on and off it&#39;s visibility (it has a lot of events)

Will it always be held at this time? I&#39;m happy to promote the events but for my mental health I cannot do 6am meetings. We could do more than one event monthly though and just have offerings at other times too. 

I really wanna support this effort and the times make it impossible.

Love it! I&#39;m having a look on trademarks and it seems that getting an international one (I guess one valid only in a country is quite useless) is quite pricey compared to the team&#39;s budget, also I&#39;m not an expert on this, maybe we could ask someone in legal. Also @Juankbell we need to ask for a quotation for the nft domain (it&#39;s got a lot of benefits with it, like getting payments in crypto on the domain). If you&#39;re busy I can do this thing

Thanks for doing this

BUDGET: So, even with simple sites, my budget suggestions are to expect $1500 for my time and $500 for software, plugins, etc. A membership site with crypto payment acceptance and user dashboards, etc., like we want will likely be another $500 for software.

Is there any way to earn $TRUST, please, Zepti?

Are there any links to explanatory documents that could explain that?

Because then that is another way in to CSTK/TEC, folk don&#39;t need to have disposable income - many of of us don&#39;t - they can earn their way in.

Would be great if these great DAOs found that way to open their doors to more talented folk.

üíØ % agreed. There is a software that summarises texts, and also software to transcribe video audio.

Adding both together could take the effort out of reporting and then learning what is happening, but I&#39;m not aware of such tools yet in OS environments.

Hey lovely souls, I wonder how you encourage parties to a dispute resolution process to open up their hearts, in spite of the fear, and try to reach a win-win scenario.

If it seems to them like it&#39;s too much work or they think they have a strategy to win the win-lose game of appealing to a mediator&#39;s opinion (or internal tribunal, ultimately arbitration, court of law..) 
they might just refuse outright or do the minimum necessary things to seem like they&#39;re trying, but not actually empathize with the other party. And rely on appeal to the next step after 7 days or so (as suggested in a recent proposal by a lawyer [https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-44-dispute-resolution-process/688/](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-44-dispute-resolution-process/688/)

I&#39;m especially interested as we at VitaDAO are trying to define this and think it&#39;s important to the long term health of the organization.

Some say we should use gravity, some that we should just use a traditional corporate &quot;tried and tested&quot; hr process.

We do have prior case studies, where Gravity personnel  have handled disputes before. You are best asking @Juankbell about these, although I would say we are trying to grow experience in the channel.

Create a safe environment filled with trust. That takes time and consistency. It could be facilitated or not, though at least at the beginning it would be better if someone led it.

Before you get to court, create safe spaces (meetings), possibly facilitated by professionals, where people can openly share feelings and unburden themselves. This could be a tool to create a different and positive communication&amp;relationship culture, establishing best practices and trying to anticipate most disputes before they arise (through trust, cooperation, openness, nvc...). Then you&#39;ll have the dispute resolution process in place (mandatory) for whatever you couldn&#39;t anticipate/mitigate,  but I think that&#39;s a further step. You&#39;ll see how a change in the environment will impact the whole organization! (Personal opinion)

Looks like the A is falling out of the word group, a metaphor that suggests exclusion, not what I look for in groups.

The colour of this one is nice, the colour of soil which nurtures life on our planet.

The symbolism here for me suggests a planet being drawn into an ecosystem, but with the possibility of emerging anew the other side. That&#39;s quite appealing.

So‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm having issues at work. 

A former supervisor has been telling people she knows what bus I take and she can kick my ass

And a couple of other women make a point of laughing out loud when they pass me in the hall. 

I did <em>not</em> submit complaints on the second set when they physically confronted me, because I knew I could get out of their department. 

The other is a supervisor who is habitually abusive. 

I think gravity can help.

I&#39;m really sorry, i thought i was going to be able to make it but i&#39;m still tangled up arranging the details of my return trip to Colombia, I would like to ask for a raincheck in today&#39;s coordination call. i will try to post here some of the things that were in the agenda to give an asynchronous update.

We continue working on the webpage, rethinking the revenue stream strategies, thinking on financial budgeting for next months and designing new proposals for DAOs to fund our projects. Also, we continue the graviton trainings and  with aragon we will be starting the tailored training for their community on the 23rd of june.

Tomorrow we have a 30 min talk for the metafam community at 7pm CET

and two more things. We want to continue promoting that we receive donations through our gitcoin grant: [https://gitcoin.co/grants/3951/gravity-conflict-management-dao](https://gitcoin.co/grants/3951/gravity-conflict-management-dao)  . and the last topic is that we might need to produce a document to track the complexity of cases, because the per case fee is being low when the scale of one case becomes bigger. So we are thinking on producing a matrix, when we could measure the size and complexity of a case, to receive graduated compensation according to the amount of work given to one case

Our objective is to promote competence about conflict transformation, while spreading a culture of prevention and self composition that supports human coord...

for example, the current fee could be useful for cases with two to three parties, but when there are more parties we could set a higher fee, or also measuring the amount of private sessions (caucuses) that differenciate a small case from a big one. and a small reward for a higher reward

I present my excuses for not joining the voice channel because im pretty distracted and would like to give the right focus on that call, but send you all a big hug, I desire we catch up soon. so stay in the loop!

On continuity, lots of ways to do this:

4Ô∏è‚É£ Spreadsheet list of WG tasks

I should note, I think usually @BiancaGadelha would take a continuity role, but she is away at the moment.

But I think you did a great job here. You should consider getting further involved, you clearly are bringing organisational skills to the group.

This is part of why I made this graphic, since I think we&#39;re all FAR too idealistic about how we solve complex problems. Each new WG or DAO seems to exude an aura of &quot;this will fix EVERYTHING!&quot; but it&#39;s going around and around and around seeing conflict as an invitation to iterate and at a certain complexity level, begin to EVOLVE.

 _18-Jun-22 03:27 AM_:

I&#39;m viewing it that ADR is actually a real prompt that says the other 3 are needed.

It&#39;s an opportunity to do further work in communities who are beginning to see the need.

As soon as they open the door, we can talk about the 3 other factors.

 _18-Jun-22 03:34 AM_:

But we have to have positivity, right?

I&#39;m a fan of Steven Covey, and in the 7 Habits he says being positive is a key first step.

I don&#39;t see positivity as excluding complexity. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, right, because we&#39;ve seen it unceasingly over history.

Further, folk are often put off by complexity, and many wouldn&#39;t even start if they understood the complexity they face on the road ahead.

Starting is an important activity, and we need to be inclusive about this. Everyone should be allowed to make a start.

How Embodied Leadership Can Take Your Work to The Next Level
There is a new ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù a new world emerging in the midst of all the chaos we currently experience. We know that our work with individuals and families makes a huge difference in their lives and in the lives of all they touch. We are called now to step into the next level of leadership, step more fully into the light of all that is calling us and give our gifts. As Jean Houston says, ‚ÄúThese are the times, and WE are the people!‚Äù What is needed now more than ever is embodied leadership. This is leadership that comes more from the heart and less from the head. It is relational, compassionate and inclusive. In this podcast we‚Äôll explore this and ways that you can begin to lead from your whole self and begin to make an even greater difference.&quot;

 _20-Jun-22 10:49 AM_:

Juan, for one. It isn&#39;t a model, as models, in Cynefin terms, lay between the realm of the Complicated and the Clear and help resolve Good Practice into Best Practice:  However, if we call ourselves a &quot;Conflict Management&quot; DAO then we have to operate in the Management Axis- between the Complex and the Complicated. 
Specifically, we need to be able to understand that ALL conflict is Complex by definition, since it&#39;s just leaping from the Chaotic aspect to the Complex. 
This map starts in Principle 1- which includes all 4 Cynefin aspects, including the Chaotic. It seems obvious we need to do this to include everyone who is dealing with things at any Cynefin level.  The second constraint is that of the Commons- how we deal with the connecting aspects between us. Principle 3 is how we treat each other interpersonally, and how we run into those awarenesses is mapped in between the Commons and each other (LS, TI, etc.) 
This is, therefore, a Map of CONSTRAINTS (the boundary between the Complex and the Complicated) and models and as such is intended to provide context to those who are engaged in Complex Work aka any type of &quot;management&quot; who need both. Management, by definition, is a Complex endeavor and it is made more Complex because human emotions are involved, especially since it&#39;s likely that they are confused and bewildered that they ended up there. 
Roughly speaking, in Cynefin terms, as you move from Complex to Complicated to Clear, you are gradually decontextualizing. Moving in the other direction, you are contextualizing. This is the latter.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622479917065/988455452369092668/climbing-cynefin-11.jpg)

Models are far, far simpler than this. Models are used to Guide Action where as Maps Guide and inform Decisions. The intention behind them is VERY different. 
Further, the Complicated and the Clear tend to think almost exclusively in Divided terms, whereas you cannot manage complexity sufficiently with a Divided mentality. This is a way to make a more Unified approach to management digestible, but it is not intended to be utilitarian, as that is a clockwise impulse. 
It should be clear, however, that each part of this 4 part map and many of the in-between parts contain a pretty large set of VERY effective MODELS that we&#39;re using throughout the TEC and in Gravity cases since our inception. So, to summarize, this is a map OF models, not a model itself. Neither is it a mandate. Mastering a toolbox of effective models makes one a more effective Graviton, and here I am explaining and contextualizing the crucial ones that I am aware of and that we already use.

 _20-Jun-22 11:07 AM_:

Finally, it&#39;s a map of the relationships between models. There are SO MANY interrelationships between of the principles here that it would be onerous to write them out, but my typical example is Ostrom&#39;s &quot;Low-Cost Conflict Resolution Mechanism&quot;. The lowest cost Conflict Resolution you can have is to set up good relationships between participants such that it creates an overall culture of Trust- one entire half of the map. Similarly, NVC has the same aim. Similarly, Principle 4&#39;s aim is to do the same thing by Transforming Conflict. This map has layers and layers and layers of complexity to it, once you see this.

 _20-Jun-22 01:32 PM_:

So, I&#39;m not sure that there is anyone who is out there &quot;championing&quot; this observation of the existing group of tools and models and their network effects and the multiplying effectiveness that using them together can create. It takes considerable complexity tolerance to hold space for all of this and understand it.

 _21-Jun-22 03:34 PM_:

this is the script for the role play we did! Contributors of the same  project in a DAO. 
Error culture. Shared responsibilities. Reconciliation.

Part a
You have been a regular contributor to a project in the DAO and normally your work gets done at the time is supposed to. 
But recently you‚Äôve been carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders from your personal life, you are ending a relationship with a partner, a close familiar passed away and your children of 12 years is having a rough time in school so you are helping them to study over nights. 
You would like to communicate to your colleagues that your regular load of work is being more demanding right now and that you would like to receive support, but everyone else seems also stressed and there are very few spaces for vulnerability, so until now you haven‚Äôt really expressed how you are feeling. 
This week you didn‚Äôt review a document that contributor b sent to share with the public, and people in the project got mad because when it got published the information shared was not precise with the latest decisions taken and it didn‚Äôt really reflected the amount of work that would be needed to complete the tasks of the project.
When you noticed that the information published was imprecise, and the group was looking for responsables, you said that it was part b fault because if they had come to the last meeting, they would have known the things that were not included in the document that was published.

After an initial public discussion in the chat of the team with part b who called you lazy for not reviewing their draft, you try to calm down and have a call with part b to look for solutions. You would also appreciate an apology from part b for calling you lazy without knowing the efforts you are making everyday.

Part b
You have been working with part a for more than 6 months now, you met IRL on a conference and until now your relationship with them has been ok, nothing profound but very work related, and without any tension.
You are in charge of making a publication about the project you two are working on, and you weren‚Äôt able to join last weeks call because it was your partners birthday. 
But you wrote what was talked last time you were in a call with the team. You sent the draft before publishing to part a about a week ago, but you didn‚Äôt receive any feedback, so you thought that the document was ok for publishing on the date it was scheduled. 
After publishing the document, you notice that the team is mad because they say that the information published was not including some key aspects that were discussed in the last call.
In a public chat part a says that is your fault, because you wrote the article, what triggers you and you respond saying that part a is lazy because you sent them the draft for review some days ago and they never responded to it.
After calming down, part a invites you to have a call and you agree with that.

You would like to see this as a shared responsibility rather than an individual mistake and you are willing to make any correction that could be agreed to by the group, either erasing the publication, making modifications or creating a new article explaining everything. It was your intention to help the team and support with your writing skills.

You would also like to receive an apology from part a for telling the rest of the team that it was your fault without recognizing their shared responsibility on the mistake.

Hi everyone! As you probably know in two hours there will be the first Graviton traning session for Aragon. Juan will lead it, but as he will be connecting from the airplane we are worried that some technical problem will arise (like not being able to connect or not having a connection stable enough to lead the meeting). Did you organize a backup or is there anyone who can back him up in case any problem arise?

Hey everyone!

This is a very interesting dispute, with a component here of how can they rebuild?

[https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip41c5-sp3-facilitator-offboarding-mkt-001/12058/2](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip41c5-sp3-facilitator-offboarding-mkt-001/12058/2) 

I would think core contributors here like @Leen could have views given their deep theory on what a reconstruction path could look like, and learning what that might be through the dispute resolution and reconciliation process.

@Juankbell if Maker DAO wasn&#39;t on your radar, can it go onto your radar, or should we wait for them to come to us?

I&#39;d like to share that diagram of yours, which is very doable since they are also in the Discourse space, and making Gravity DAO visible via Discourse seems a decent way forward.

And Gravity need to do this moving forward to fit in with the Financial Hack initiative.

But maybe Juan you agree that we need more Active Gravitons to provide support to Gravity DAO in such activities?

I think folk like @bends could be such folk.

What do you think, Juan? FYI @BiancaGadelha

> I haven‚Äôt seen any content that stands out off the top of my head right now, or that made me take time out of my day to watch, which I believe would be the goal of a content team. That said, I‚Äôm open to rebuttal if there are explanations for the lack of performance here and a plan to improve going forward. Otherwise this makes sense to me.
